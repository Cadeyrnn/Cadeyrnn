# 👋 Hi, I'm Cadeyrn Neville

I'm a professional rugby union player for the ACT Brumbies and have represented Australia at the international level. Off the field, I've recently been diving into the world of software development and exploring what it has to offer.

## 🧠 My Developer Journey

I got started with programming through Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), which sparked my interest in building and problem-solving with code. Since then, I've completed **CS50P** (Python) and **CS50AI**, and am now working through CS50W. I am now familiar with most of the content but I place a high value on knowing the basics so going over it again through CS50's delivery seems worthwhile.

## 💻 Current Focus

- Learning and building with **Python**
- Exploring **AI concepts** and how they apply to real-world problems
- Beginning to learn **JavaScript** and frameworks
- Working through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) modules for cybersecurity skills
- Studying Bachelor of Construction Management at University of Newcastle

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

- Python (main focus)
- Git & GitHub
- A bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (more to come)
- VS Code, Raycast, Tailscale and other workflow tools

## 🏉 Background

Balancing professional sport and a young family while also studying has definitely been a challenge but that is the way I prefer things to be. I have always been interested in tech and computers but only more recently decided to really learn whats it's all about and is now something I would like to pursue in some way once I have hung up the rugby boots. 

## 🔭 What's Next?

- Working through the Github Student Developer Pack to get solid basics
- Learning throuugh [CS50 projects](https://github.com/code50/159509190.git)
- Build and ship small projects
- Dive deeper into web development (probably React and Node.js)
- Learn backend and DevOps fundamentals
- Collaborate on open-source projects
